    <string name="chicken">Chicken will vary in time to cook depending on the thickness of the chicken. It can be useful to pound the meat to make it thinner or poke holes with a utensil to quicken cooking time.
Chicken is safe to eat at 165 degrees(F) and can still be slightly pink, so colour isn’t the only indicator of doneness.
</string>
    <string name="chicken2">A good way to check is to hold your finger in the middle of the chicken and if its too ho to hold for more than ½ second then you’re done.
An immediate way to cook is to sear the chicken in a hot pan for 3-4 minutes each side and then finish off in the oven.</string>
